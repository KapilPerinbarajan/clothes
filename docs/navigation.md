- The user flow for your e-commerce website begins with the **Create Account** page, where new users register by providing their details. After registration, they are directed to the **Login Page** to log in with their credentials. Once logged in, users are taken to the **Home Page**, which displays featured products and offers. From there, they can browse the **Product Listing Page**, where they can filter and sort products by categories, size, and price. Clicking on a product will take them to the **Product Detail Page**, where they can view more information and add items to their **Cart**. In the **Cart Page**, users can review their selected items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout. After confirming their order, theyâ€™re directed to the **Order Confirmation Page**. Users can also visit the **Account Page** to manage their profile, view order history, and update addresses.
